# 50 leaves - sample F# solution
This is a sample solution with the following structure:
- Top.fsproj referencing the following:
- 50 leaves `leaf_0..leaf_49`

Each project contains an `.fs` file with several thousand lines of code.

## Goals
This solution was created to test parallel code analysis of FCS.
